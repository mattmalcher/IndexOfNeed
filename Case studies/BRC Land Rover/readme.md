# British Red Cross case study: Land Rover Support at Home services
Land Rover funds 11 projects in locations around the UK to provide support to people suffering from social isolation, particularly in rural areas.

The aim of this case study is to develop an indicator for the availability (or lack) of transport to key services, as well as mapping the rural-ness of existing service users.

The code in this folder uses [data about journey times](https://github.com/mattmalcher/IndexOfNeed/wiki/Data-Source-%E2%80%90-Journey-Times-to-Key-Services) to create a single numerical index representing distance from key services. It also combines this index with [rural-urban classification data](https://github.com/mattmalcher/IndexOfNeed/wiki/Data-Source-%E2%80%90-Rural-Urban-Classification) and produces a binary measure of whether a postcode is rural or urban.
